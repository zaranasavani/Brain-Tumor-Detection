# Brain Tumor Detection

This project is focused on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI images. Brain tumors can have serious health implications, and timely detection is crucial for effective treatment. The goal of this project is to create an automated system that can classify MRI images as either showing a brain tumor (Yes) or not showing a brain tumor (No) with high accuracy.

The CNN model has been trained on a dataset containing MRI images labeled with "Yes" for images showing a tumor and "No" for images without a tumor. This binary classification problem leverages the power of deep learning to analyze and interpret medical imaging data, providing a reliable tool for assisting medical professionals in the diagnostic process.


## Features

- CNN Architecture: A robust Convolutional Neural Network designed for high accuracy in image classification tasks.
- Training and Validation: Training the model on a labeled dataset with evaluation metrics to measure performance.
- Binary Classification: Classifying images into two categories: "Tumor" and "No Tumor."
